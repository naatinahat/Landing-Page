    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheesy lasagna made using shredded chicken in place of ground beef or sausage.</p>
    <p>Delicious as fuck</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 each skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add chicken breasts; reduce heat and let simmer until chicken falls apart easily with a fork and is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain water, shred chicken with 2 forks, and set aside.</li>
        <li>While chicken is boiling, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and lay noodles in a single, flat layer on a paper towel to dry.</li>
      </ol>
